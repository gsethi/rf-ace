= Description =

RF-ACE is an efficient C++ implementation of a robust machine learning algorithm for uncovering multivariate associations from large and diverse data sets. RF-ACE natively handles numerical and categorical data with missing values, and potentially large quantities of noninformative features are handled gracefully utilizing artificial contrast features, bootstrapping, and p-value estimation.

= Installation =

Download the latest stable release from the [http://code.google.com/p/rf-ace/downloads/list download page], or checkout the latest development version (to directory rf-ace/) by typing

{{{
svn checkout http://rf-ace.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rf-ace
}}}

In Linux, you can compile the program by typing 

{{{
make
}}}
or
{{{
make rf_ace
}}}

Check compiled binaries at the [http://code.google.com/p/rf-ace/downloads/list download page]. (A compiler script for Visual Studio will soon be provided.)

= Supported data formats =
RF-ACE currently supports two file formats, Annotated Feature Matrix (AFM) and Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF).

== Annotated Feature Matrix (AFM) ==

Annotated Feature Matrix represents the data as a tab-delimited table, where both columns and rows contain headers describing the samples and features. Based on the headers, the AFM reader is able to discern the right orientation (features as rows or columns in the matrix) of the matrix. Namely AFM feature headers must encode whether the feature is (N)umerical, (C)ategorical, (O)rdinal, or (B)inary, followed by colon and the actual name of the feature as follows:

 * B:is_alive
 * N:age
 * C:tumor_grage 
 * O:anatomic_organ_subdivision

In fact any string, even including colons, spaces, and other special characters, encodes a valid feature name as long as it starts with the preamble "N/C/O/B:". Thus, the following is a valid feature header:

 * N:GEXP:TP53:chr17:123:456

Sample headers are not constrained, except that they must not contain preambles "N/C/O/B:" existing solely in the feature headers. 

== Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF) ==

= Usage =

Type 
{{{
bin/rf_ace --help
}}}
or 
{{{
bin/rf_ace -h
}}}
to bring up help:
{{{
REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:
 -I / --input        input feature file (AFM or ARFF)
 -i / --target       target, specified as integer or string that is to be matched with the content of input
 -O / --output       output association file

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:
 -n / --ntrees       number of trees per RF (default nsamples/nrealsamples)
 -m / --mtry         number of randomly drawn features per node split (default sqrt(nfeatures))
 -s / --nodesize     minimum number of train samples per node, affects tree depth (default max{5,nsamples/20})
 -p / --nperms       number of Random Forests (default 50)
 -t / --pthreshold   p-value threshold below which associations are listed (default 0.1)
 -g / --gbt          Enable (1 == YES) Gradient Boosting Trees, a subsequent filtering procedure (default 0 == NO)
}}} 

RF-ACE can simply be run by typing
{{{
bin/rf_ace --input featurematrix.afm --targetidx 123 --output associations.tsv 
}}}
or with the short-hand notation equivalently as
{{{
bin/rf_ace -I featurematrix.afm -i 123 -O associations.tsv 
}}}
which will execute RF-ACE with the default parameters; as the help documentation points out, most of the parameters are estimated dynamically based on the data dimensions and content, so running RF-ACE with no information about the algorithm itself is possible.
