RF-ACE is a robust machine learning algorithm for uncovering multivariate 
associations from large and diverse data sets. RF-ACE natively handles numerical and categorical data with missing values, 
and potentially large quantities of noninformative features is 
handled gracefully utilizing a bootstrapping and false discovery rate estimation approach. 
The algorithm is adapted from the one proposed in [http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/tuv09a/tuv09a.pdf].

INSTALLATION
Currently there are no compiled binaries available, but a Linux Makefile is provided along with the source code. 
Just run "make" or "make rf_ace".

PREREQUISITES
A feature matrix that has samples as columns and features as rows. Both features and samples must be identifiable by
a header. Sample names can be formatted freely, whereas feature headers must follow a certain syntax. Namely, feature 
type should be explicitly denoted, whether it's a numerical (N), categorical (C), or binary (B). The example below
illustrates a valid feature matrix.

Categorical features can contain strings, integers, floats, as they will just be treated as unique
class identifiers. Also note how missing values are indiciated by NA or NAN.
